Exercises:

1. Write a program to prompt user to enter two integers
   and determine if the first number is a multiple of the second number.

2. Write a program to prompt user to enter the lengths of three sides of a triangle.
   Determine if these three lengths do indeed form a triangle.
   Three lines can make up a triangle as long as every side is < sum of the other two sides.

3. Play the guess the number game.  Your program randomly generates an integer 
   between 0 and 100 (inclusively).  Prompts the user to guess what this number is
   (letting the user know the range).  Give feedback on whether guess is right or wrong,
   if wrong, keep guessing.

   What's your birth month (in word, spelled in full)?
   What's your birth year?
   Find this birthday, in the format of 
   [month as integer][day as integer][last 2 digits of year],
   in the first million digits of Pi.
   Print out which digits of pi this birthday is at, maybe neighbourhood of these digits.
