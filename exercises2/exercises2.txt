1. Create a Book class, with title and id;
   constructor; methods to get and set the title.
   Create a BookList class, using ArrayList<Book>.
   constructor; methods to add and get book; toString().

2. Write a program to calculate factorial(n), n! = n*(n-1)*(n-2)*...*2*1
   Write a main method to call factorial n times to print the factorials from 1! to n!
   Run it with factorial(30)

3. Create a new class called Rational, has two instance variables, both ints: 
   numerator, denominator.

   Write a constructor that takes no arguments, numerator = 0, denominator = 1.
   Write a second constructor that takes two ints and sets the num and denom to those.
   Write a toString() method to print the fraction.

   Write the modifier methods:
     negate() - flips the sign of the Rational (numerator)
     invert() - inverts the fraction
     reduce() - reduces the fraction to its most reduced form so that
                numerator and denominator have no common factors (except 1)
	      - need to use gcd(a, b), greatest common divisor of two numbers a and b
              - a > b, r = a % b -->  gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, r) = ... = gcd(b, 0)
                --> b is the gcd
   
   Write the (non-modifier, pure function) methods:
     toDouble() - returns the floating point value of the Rational object (fraction)
     add() - returns the sum of two Rationals, as a Rational object
